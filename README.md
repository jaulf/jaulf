# Howard Otuya - User Experience Designer and Web Developer âš¡

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Howard Otuya, a passionate User Experience (UX) designer based in Lagos. I have a strong background in Web Development, with three years of hands-on experience. However, I encountered challenges when it came to building user-focused products with a strong emphasis on user accessibility. This led me to embark on a transformative journey into the world of User Experience.

## About Me ðŸŒ±

I thrive on the excitement of learning, building things, and solving problems. For me, user experience design is more than just a jobâ€”it's my Happy Place. I firmly believe that creating usable, user-centric products is the cornerstone of successful digital experiences.

## Let's Connect ðŸ“«

I am always eager to connect with fellow professionals, share knowledge, and collaborate on exciting projects. I believe that by learning from each other, we can collectively grow and push the boundaries of what is possible in the field of UX design.
